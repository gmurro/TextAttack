My only problem is that there are no signs directing you at the Complex where everything is.  <font color = red>as</font> then we have figured out exactly where the dog park is and the <font color = red>imum</font> place to park (hint: turn onto Carver Rd and you can park in the lot right in front of the dog park.

The times we have been to the park, there have been about 15-20 dogs which is a good amount. There are benches for the owners to sit on, as well as some picnic tables. Additionally, there are bags for dog poop and <font color = red>taps</font> for water, so if you forget bottled water it's no <font color = red>help</font>.

"Quick background: Asian guy who <font color = red>loves</font> sushi in Phoenix for the Dodgers Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""""star-rating\"""" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\<font color = red>nWe</font> walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\<font color = red>n</font>\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the ordinary. You got your rolls found in every Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food shortly right? Nope. Begin the clock. With nothing to do besides talk and drink the water we were given. Minutes fly by and before I knew it, it was already 40 minutes after our order and a group of 10 Giants fans walk in. As I curse quietly to myself I log onto my Yelp app to actually read reviews about the place. At this <font color = red>point</font> it is more than 45 minutes after we <font color = red>ordered</font> and <font color = red>I</font> stumble upon Jamie <font color = red>M</font>.'s review where she <font color = red>mentioned</font> that it took the the staff over 35 <font color = red>minutes</font> for them to inform her that something she ordered was <font color = red>unavailable</font>. <font color = red>As</font> I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \<font color = red>n</font>\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 average sized <font color = red>pieces</font> of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). <font color = red>The</font> fried soft shell crab was missing a <font color = red>key</font> <font color = red>ingredient</font>... the soft shell crab. Also this roll was <font color = red>poorly</font> rolled... by that I mean just using my chop sticks to <font color = red>even</font> attempt to <font color = red>place</font> it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even <font color = red>sticking</font> to the sushi \""""filling\"""" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""""x1\"""" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""""review\""""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""""chef\"""" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""""best\"""" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi. There's got to be somewhere better than this.","Quick background: Asian guy who <font color = green>found</font> sushi in Phoenix for the Dodgers Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things.

At this <font color = green>times</font> it is more than 45 minutes after we <font color = green>ordering</font> and <font color = green>they</font> stumble upon Jamie <font color = green>m</font>.'s review where she <font color = green>explained</font> that it took the the staff over 35 <font color = green>minute</font> for them to inform her that something she ordered was <font color = green>available</font>. <font color = green>although</font> I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \<font color = green>nc</font>\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 average sized <font color = green>varieties</font> of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). <font color = green>this</font> fried soft shell crab was missing a <font color = green>fair</font> <font color = green>bit</font>... the soft shell crab. Also this roll was <font color = green>partially</font> rolled... by that I mean just using my chop sticks to <font color = green>only</font> attempt to <font color = green>shove</font> it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even <font color = green>inferior</font> to the sushi \""""filling\"""" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""""x1\"""" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""""review\""""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""""chef\"""" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""""best\"""" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi. There's got to be somewhere better than this.",0.0002219080924987793,0.5727578401565552,0,1,0,1033,"Successful"

If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders. \n\nTheir food is pretty pricey as well and their <font color = green>serving</font> sizes are pretty small. <font color = green>one</font> dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you. \n\n\nOther than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix. \n\nI'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol. \n\nOh and the brown haired girl, I think her name is Sasha, looks pissed off all the time(she is pretty hot though) And the tall white guy, I think his name is Sammy, is pretty bi-polar. Sometimes he is nice; other times he's an asshole.",0.0001558065414428711,0.7325782775878906,0,1,0,278,"Successful"

"I mean really how can you beat a movie theater with extremely cheap tickets??  Yeah it's not the newest or the nicest, or even the cleanest (bathrooms are yuck).
