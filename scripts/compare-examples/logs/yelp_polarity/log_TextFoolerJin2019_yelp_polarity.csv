"I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. There's a few reasons why:\n\n1.

The energy in the place is <font color = green>always</font> <font color = green>happy</font>, <font color = green>probably</font> <font color = green>attributable</font> to point #1.\n\n3. The beer. I hear their cocktails are great too, but I haven't actually had them. I have, on the other hand, had several 12-snit beer flights there and I can safely say I've tasted everything they have on tap. The biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely Wisconsin-local beers. I love that, even though (and maybe especially because) I'm from out of state. Their presentation (on giant slabs of wood) for the beer flights is pretty awesome, too.\n\n4. The food I've had there is the only thing I might hesitate on for the 5-star rating (I'd have preferred to give a 4.5). I love their Wurst Platter (which can easily feed 3 people for about $15), and some of their burgers are very good, but I've found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of. If you're into that, right on. I have a little trouble getting through meals, though. Lots of food for relatively inexpensive cost. \n\n5. Everything else, like the service and the outdoor seating and the text system for getting a table. All outstanding.","I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.

"Quick background: Asian guy who loves sushi in Phoenix for the Dodgers Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""""star-rating\"""" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\nWe walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\n\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the ordinary. You got your rolls found in every Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food shortly right? Nope. Begin the clock. With nothing to do besides talk and drink the water we were given. Minutes fly by and before I knew it, it was already 40 minutes after our order and a group of 10 Giants fans walk in. As I curse quietly to myself I log onto my Yelp app to actually read reviews about the place. At this point it is more than 45 minutes after we ordered and I stumble upon Jamie M.'s review where she mentioned that it took the the staff over 35 minutes for them to inform her that something she ordered was unavailable. As I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \n\nFood:::::\nSpider <font color = red>roll</font>: Made of 6 <font color = red>average</font> sized <font color = red>pieces</font> of sushi (<font color = red>costed</font> $12.50 <font color = red>btw</font>). The fried soft shell crab was missing a key <font color = red>ingredient</font>... the soft shell crab. <font color = red>Also</font> this <font color = red>roll</font> was <font color = red>poorly</font> <font color = red>rolled</font>... by that <font color = red>I</font> <font color = red>mean</font> just <font color = red>using</font> my <font color = red>chop</font> sticks to even <font color = red>attempt</font> to <font color = red>place</font> it in my <font color = red>mouth</font> was a <font color = red>chore</font>. The <font color = red>rice</font> was not even <font color = red>sticking</font> to the <font color = red>sushi</font> \""""<font color = red>filling</font>\"""" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""""x1\"""" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""""review\""""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""""chef\"""" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""""best\"""" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi.
