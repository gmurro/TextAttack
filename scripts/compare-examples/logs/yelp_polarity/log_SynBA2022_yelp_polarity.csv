"I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've <font color = green>decided</font> this is one of my favorite <font color = green>restaurants</font> in Madison. There's a few reasons why:\n\n1. I'll start off with the fact that this place has far-and-away the best cheese curds I've tasted yet. Granted I'm not a Wisconsin native, but I can appreciate good food when I see it. The Old Fashioned's curds are the tastiest, gooiest, squeakiest, and have the <font color = green>best</font> texture of anywhere else I've been. They're a must-have, hands down.\n\n2. The atmosphere is perfect. It's the <font color = green>kind</font> of <font color = green>place</font> where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and tie to a t-shirt and shorts. It has this rustic, busy feeling that feels both modern and, well, old <font color = green>fashioned</font>. The energy in the place is always <font color = green>happy</font>, probably attributable to point #1.\n\n3. The beer. I <font color = green>hear</font> their cocktails are great too, but I haven't actually had them. I have, on the other hand, had several 12-snit beer <font color = green>flights</font> there and I can safely say I've tasted everything they have on tap. The biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely Wisconsin-local beers. I love that, even though (and maybe especially because) I'm from out of state. Their <font color = green>presentation</font> (on giant <font color = green>slabs</font> of <font color = green>wood</font>) for the beer flights is pretty awesome, too.\n\n4. The food I've had there is the only thing I might hesitate on for the 5-star <font color = green>rating</font> (I'd have preferred to give a 4.5). I love their Wurst Platter (which can easily feed 3 people for about $15), and some of their burgers are very good, but I've found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of. If you're into that, right on. I have a little trouble getting through meals, though.

"Quick <font color = red>background</font>: Asian guy who loves sushi in Phoenix for the <font color = red>Dodgers</font> Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""""star-rating\"""" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\nWe walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\n\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the <font color = red>ordinary</font>. You got your rolls found in <font color = red>every</font> Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food <font color = red>shortly</font> right? <font color = red>Nope</font>. Begin the clock. With nothing to do besides talk and drink the water we were given. Minutes fly by and before I knew it, it was already 40 minutes after our order and a group of 10 Giants fans walk in. As I <font color = red>curse</font> <font color = red>quietly</font> to myself I log onto my Yelp app to actually read reviews about the place. At this point it is more than 45 minutes after we ordered and I stumble upon Jamie M.'s review where she mentioned that it took the the staff over 35 minutes for them to inform her that something she ordered was <font color = red>unavailable</font>. As I <font color = red>read</font> it to my group we are <font color = red>FINALLY</font> <font color = red>served</font> after 50 minutes. \n\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 <font color = red>average</font> sized pieces of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). The fried soft shell crab was missing a key ingredient... the soft shell crab. Also this <font color = red>roll</font> was <font color = red>poorly</font> rolled... by that I <font color = red>mean</font> just using my chop sticks to even <font color = red>attempt</font> to place it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even <font color = red>sticking</font> to the sushi \""""filling\"""" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""""x1\"""" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""""review\""""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""""chef\"""" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""""best\"""" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi. There's got to be somewhere better than this.","Quick <font color = green>backdrop</font>: Asian guy who loves sushi in Phoenix for the <font color = green>Sox</font> Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""""star-rating\"""" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\nWe walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\n\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the <font color = green>typical</font>. You got your rolls found in <font color = green>each</font> Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food <font color = green>slightly</font> right? <font color = green>Nan</font>. Begin the clock.
