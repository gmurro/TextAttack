It has its own starting point, and its own end point. One works through Shusaku Endo's text marveling at its simplicity, gentleness, and warmth. Not scholarly, it does not miss a beat in offending the academic exegetes of today whose attempts at commentary Endo leaves far, far behind with his display of understanding and appreciation of this Christ. And the book's end point-- one is saddened when it comes because through Endo one has been brought back to the life of a great and good Man, Whom many still today believe was God incarnate.
