The way in which Sophia reacts when she thinks she's in love with Cruise's character. Squeeling like a child. And to top it all off, Tom Cruise couldn't dare to hide his face under grotesque makeup (as did Edwardo Noriega in the far superior and more mature ""<font color = green>Apenas</font> Los Ojos"") because afterall, how else would people recognize the great Tom Cruise.And if someone can explain the title, be my guest.Two <font color = green>thumb</font> way down.",0.0002543330192565918,0.656427264213562,0,1,0,196,"Successful"

"I thought the sound quality was fine. The battery life is great. But there are some little problems. For one thing, it doesn't let you skip forward within a track. That's a problem if you're listening to a book that has hour long tracks, e.g., audible.com. More importantly, after a few months mine simply stopped being a CD player. It's still a fine radio, but it doesn't play CDs of any kind. So far as I know, it was never dropped or anything.
